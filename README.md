# Raspberrypi_Yocto_Sensor_Node_ML_Kernel_User_Space
In this project, I will develop following things.
-  Kernel device drivers for OLED connected with I2C
-  Kernel device drivers for OLED connected with SPI
-  Kernel device drivers for BME280 connected with SPI
-  User Application (Layered designed with C++17)
    - Read sensor data
    - Write it on Displays
    - Send data to AWS server
    - Run AI Linear regression model to guage temprature / pressure / humidity
